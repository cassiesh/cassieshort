## About Me

Hi! I am Postdoc in the Psychological Methods and Statistics Lab at the Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg in Germany.
My academic career started in the UK, where I earned my PhD investigating the neural correlates of facial mimicry in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. After that, I moved to Germany for my first postdoc position, spending three years in the Differential Psychology Lab at the University of Hamburg, working on the [CoScience Project](https://www.coscience-personality.com/). This led me to my current Postdoc position in Oldenburg, which I have enjoyed immensely since January 2023. 
Over the years, I've built a solid foundation in EEG and methods research and in teaching. I'm passionate about contributing to the scientific community through publications, teaching workshops, contributing to conferences, leading and jining scientific committees, peer-reviewing research, and teaching and mentoring students. 
My research interests are quite braod, but I am especially excited about electrophysiological correlates of personality, reliable ERP quantification measures, dual-EEG recordings, inter-person neuroscience, multiverse analysis, meta-science and open science. 
If any of that sparks your interest, please feel free to get in touch!
