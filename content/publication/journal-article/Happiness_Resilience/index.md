abstract: While the positive relationship between happiness and resilience amongst students is established, diversity in further education (FE) students warrants investigation into potential differences in the strength of this relationship. In respect of the multifaceted definition of the concept, two happiness measures were completed by respondents. This allowed investigation into the potential for the two measures to reflect differing features of happiness and allowed a more specific insight into the role happiness plays in the resilience of FE students. In this study, the predictive relationships of happiness with resilience among three level 3 populations – A-Level, BTEC and Access to HE at a further education college in the UK (N = 443) – are examined by means of self-report. Multiple regression analysis showed that happiness measures correlate with resilience, making independent contributions. Relative importance of happiness measures in predicting resilience also differs across pathways. Findings are discussed in terms of diversity of FE students and diversity of happiness within these populations. This research highlights a variation in significance of different facets of happiness on resilience, with implications for pastoral care in FE.
