abstract: Despite a plethora of research, associations between individual differences in personality and electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters remain poorly understood due to concerns of low replicability and insufficiently powered data analyses due to relatively small effect sizes. The present article describes how a multi-laboratory team of EEG-personality researchers aims to alleviate this unsatisfactory status quo. In particular, the present article outlines the design and methodology of the project, provides a detailed overview of the resulting large-scale dataset that is available for use by future collaborators, and forms the basis for consistency and depth to the methodology of all resulting empirical articles. Through this article, we aim to inform researchers in the field of Personality Neuroscience of the freely available dataset. Furthermore, we assume that researchers will generally benefit from this detailed example of the implementation of cooperative forking paths analysis.
