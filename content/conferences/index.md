## Conference Organisation

**18 July 2025 â€” The UOL Open Science Conference**  
As co-lead of the Open Science Interest Group (OSIG) of the Psychology Department at the Carl von Ossietzky UniversitÃ¤t Oldenburg (UOL), I have organised a one-day interdisciplinary conference bringing together staff and students across all career stages to discuss open science initiatives and challenges. The aim is to provide a platform for learning, building cross-disciplinary collaborations, supporting open science initiatives at UOL, establishing university-wide connections for OSIG, and inspiring the creation of open science interest groups in other departments.

**24â€“25 June 2025 â€” Enhancing replicability in EEG Individual Differences research through individually parameterised single trial EEG**  
As part of my Associate Junior Fellowship at the Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg Delmenhorst (HWK), I am organising a two-day workshop exploring strategies to evaluate and improve the validity of single-trial EEG estimates. Several well-established researchers from around the world will join the workshop and contribute to the discussion. I hope that our collaborative paper following this workshop will enhance reproducibility in EEG individual differences research.
