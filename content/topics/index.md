### EEG Individual Differences
I am particularly interested in how individual differences in personality are associated with patterns of neural activity, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG). During my postdoctoral work on the CoScience Project, as one of two postdocs employed to oversee the implementation of the project, I investigated the robustness of various EEG–personality associations to defensible variability in data processing, EEG parameterisation, and analysis across a variety of EEG individual differences hypotheses.

A central aim of my work is to develop improved estimation techniques that help to answer key research questions about individual differences with greater validity and reproducibility.

### EEG Methodological Development - Towards Individualised EEG Parameterisation
A central aim of my work is to develop highly precise individualised spatial and temporal single-trial ERP parameterisation techniques to enhance the validity and reproducibility of EEG individual differences research. Individualised and dynamic ERP parameterisation can better account for intra- and inter-individual variability, which holds promise for estimating more reproducible associations between neural activity and personality traits. My current Associate Junior Fellowship supports this line of work by funding a dedicated collaborative methods workshop. I am also interested in the broader applications of this methodological advancement, such as the improvement of diagnostic sensitivity and the assessment of cognitive functioning.

### Metascience
I am deeply committed to advancing scientific transparency and rigour through metascientific research. My work in this area focuses primarily on two domains:

1. Multiverse Analysis: I actively apply multiverse analysis to assess the robustness of research findings across defensible variations in data processing and analytic decisions. Beyond application, I am also engaged in the methodological development of this approach. In particular, I am focusing on reducing the uncertainty associated with pipeline sampling in large-scale multiverse designs, and on formalising the decision-making process to construct multiverse analyses in a more systematic and transparent way. These developments aim to improve the utility of multiverse analysis as a tool for reducing sources of uncertainty. I also collaborate within a multi-disciplinary working group that is dedicated to bringing cohesion in multiverse practices across scientific fields.

2. Replication Terminology: I am contributing to a cross-disciplinary initiative working to develop a shared vocabulary that can more precisely describe the spectrum of replication and reproduction practices. This effort seeks to promote conceptual clarity and greater cohesion across disciplines in how replication-related constructs are communicated and operationalised.

### Inter-person Neuroscience
My earlier work used dual-EEG (hyperscanning) in child-parent dyads to investigate the neural correlates of features of social interactions between children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and their parents. This sparked an interest in inter-brain neural synchrony and compensation, and its potential as a marker of interpersonal attunement. In future research, I aim to return to this method to explore how synchronous and compensatory dynamics vary across individuals and relationships, and how it may be modulated by personality, affect, or context. I hope to supervise student theses on this topic in the coming years.

### Open Science
Open science is a core dimension of my research philosophy and academic practice. I currently co-lead the Open Science Interest Group (OSIG) of the Department of Psychology at the Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg, through which I have introduced and coordinated several grass-roots initiatives, including a university-wide open science conference, a ReproducibiliTEA journal club, and the further integration of open science principles into the curriculum. I regularly give workshops and presentations on open science topics. I am committed to promoting a culture of transparency and collaborative knowledge building.
