This section outlines my primary research interests.

## EEG Individual Differences
I am interested in associations between EEG markers and personality traits. As a postdoctoral researcher on the CoScience Project, I explored the robustness of multiple EEG - personality associations. A major goal of my work is to develop methodological advances in EEG estimation to better answer individual differences research questions with increased validity.

## EEG Methodological Development - Towards Individualised EEG Parameterisation
I have a strong interest in evaluating single-trial EEG estimations for use in individual differences research, aiming to enhance the robustness and validity of estimates and subsequent brain-behaviour, brain-cognition, and brain-trait relationships. This includes evaluating and developing algorithms for individualised single-trial EEG parameterisation. My current Associate Junior Fellowship supports the development of this research topic through workshop funding.

## Metascience
I am passionate about metascience, with two main strands of activity:

1. Multiverse Analysis: I am very active in using and developing multiverse methodology. I am also part of a multi-disciplinary research interest group dedicated to advancing this analytical approach and bringing cohesion between disciplines.
2. Replication Terminology: I am a member of a research interest group working to develop a cross-disciplinary taxonomy of terms related to replication and reproducibility â€” building a shared vocabulary to precisely describe the variety of ways research studies can be "re-done".

## Inter-person Neuroscience
I have experience with dual-EEG (hyperscanning) recordings involving children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and their parents. This work sparked a deep interest in inter-brain synchrony. I am excited about returning to this method in future work to explore individual differences and relational dynamics in between-person neural synchrony.

## Open Science
I am engaged in multiple initiatives that aim to improve the transparency and reproducibility of science. For example, I co-lead my current department's Open Science Interest Group and, in doing so, have organised a university-wide open science conferemce, spoken at open science conferences on the topic of bottom-up open science intitiatives, delivered open science-related workshops to researchers and students at various stages of their careers, and started a ReproducibiliTEA Journal Club. I publish open data, materials, code and access where possible. I am strongly committed to further improving my own implementation and supporting others to implement open science practices.
